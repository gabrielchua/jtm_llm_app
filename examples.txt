Account Assistant (Financial Accounting)

The impact on junior FA roles such as Accountant/ Senior Accounts
Executive (SAE) and Accounts Executive/ Accounts Assistant (AE) is
expected to be high, as their tasks are predominantly transactional, high-
volume, repetitive and rule-based.
As automation and technology adoption become more prevalent in the FA
process area, repetitive transactional tasks and those that follow a clearly
defined logic could be replaced by process automation or workflow
solutions. Tasks such as reviewing the numerical accuracy and completeness
of financial reports, for example, can be replaced by automation tools.

Specifically:
• In Procure to Pay, the effort to read hard-copy invoices and transpose data into the system will
gradually be replaced by electronic invoices – either using OCR and ML to read hard-copy invoices
or offering vendor portals for suppliers to directly input invoice details. Together with the use of
purchase orders, and automated budget checking, standard invoice processing will require minimal
human intervention.
• In Order to Cash, billing and reconciliation of collections will gradually be replaced by accounting
systems that are integrated with banking platforms. SAEs and AEs may still need to follow up with
customers on collections, but the task of issuing rule-based payment reminders will be automated.
• In Record to Report, accounting systems will be able to prepare standard and recurring journal
adjustments as well as standard financial reports. Financial consolidation and disclosure
management solutions will help automate consolidated financial statements and disclosure
reporting.

Overall, the job tasks performed by SAEs and AEs are at risk of being displaced by automation. Up to
60 percent of manual and repetitive tasks, such as data entry, will be automated. Some tasks will shift
towards validating data and managing exceptions in the accounting systems.

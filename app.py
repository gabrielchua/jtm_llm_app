### Assumed Problem Statement üîç

How might we measure the quality of jobs and programmes relative to the Job Transform Maps (JTMs) in order to identify and promote quality jobs for Singaporeans?

JTMs: https://www.wsg.gov.sg/home/employers-industry-partners/jobs-transformation-maps

### General Approach üß≠

1. Extract portions of JTMs that describe the future job
2. Generate a hypothetical JD based on the JTM extract using a large language model 
3. Calculate a similarity score between JTM-based JD (i.e. goal) against existing JDs (e.g. on MCF)

In this POC, we demonstrate the above using a simple front-end that ranks 3 user-provided JDs against the user-provided JTM extract.

This approach can generally scale to larger applications.

### Potential Applications üíª
                     
1. **Citizens:** Identify "JTM-aligned" jobs on MCF
2. **Employers:** Nudge job redesign efforts
3. **WSG and Sectoral Agencies:** Measure progress of JTM implementation over time

                       value="""In Corporate Banking, the Relationship Managers (RMs)
role will be augmented by data analytics and automation
to focus on managing mid-sized corporate clients. Unlike
small enterprises, subsidiaries or FIs (where information is
available and accessible), the industry shared that managing
medium enterprises tends to be slightly more complex.
A new approach to segmentation (emphasising on behaviours
and needs, rather than revenue) will allow banks to gain
better understanding of the complexity of client tranches,
where ultimately the RM could prioritise their efforts on
the most valuable customers.
The future of this role will shift from reactive to more
proactive management of client accounts by leveraging
software/analytics that gather intelligence to identify cross
selling opportunities (this is not limited to FX, trade or cash
management). As with the role of Product Sales, digital
and self-service platforms have been implemented to support
the acquisition for simple accounts as well as other post-sales
activities. With the right tools in place, RMs can anticipate
different client needs and provide bespoke recommendations
that lead to a more meaningful exchange with their clients.

Skills Implication:
Whilst lateral thinking and advisory skills are inherent
for this role, future RMs will need to be proficient with
different tools, and understand how to leverage them to
further improve their engagement with clients. Rather
than merely understanding the theories, they also need
to be proficient in the application of data, specifically
learning how to interpret information and translate
insights into sound decisions or solutions.
